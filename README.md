## Background
<div>
If you remember the 90's, it's hard to forget this addictive classic. This project is my version of the classic, using the Turtle Class in Python.
</div>

This project took me on a trip down memory lane to pure 90s nostalgia.

## How to Play (with my code):

### Click on the Snake to play <a href="https://replit.com/@meljcode/my-snake-game#README.md">üêç</a> 

1. Click "run" at the top of the screen.
2. Click on the game to activate.

### Snake Controls:
<div>
‚¨ÜÔ∏è - Up
  </div>
<div>
‚¨áÔ∏è - Down
  </div>

** If the snake is already moving in a direction, selecting it will do nothing! **



### Game Rules:

Just like in the original, the rules are simple - Eat to grow, and don't touch the walls **or your own tail**!
