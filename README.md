## Background
<div>
If you remember the 90's, it's hard to forget this addictive classic. 
</div>

Completing this took me on a trip down memory lane to pure 90s nostalgia...

## Code Approach

I build this game using turtle which is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. 


### Classes:
The **main.py** file contains the code which displays the screen (where you play the game) as well as the game components, which are imported from separate python files. This file is where the game is run.

<div>
  
**snake.py.py** - A Class for the snake's body. The snake is given a starting postion and initial body size. Functions are created to add a segment to the snake's body if it eats the food, reset the starting position if a collision is made, and how to control the snake.
</div>

<div>
  
**food.py** - A Class for the food the snake is trying to get. A function is created to move the target food once the snake has sucessfully eaten it.
  
</div>

<div>
  
**scoreboard.py** - A Class for keeping your score. Fuctions are created to keep score, update the highest score (so you can beat your own score), and reset.
  
  </div>
  
### Hosting the game on Replit:

<div>
To get the code to run as a game, I created a .replit file (config file):
